ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vidhi Patel. I am currently a student studying Computer Science in University. I have coded in Python, C/C++, and Java. I am very interested in learning more coding languages and softwares as I have created websites and apps. I really like creating things and coding is an outlet for me that allows me to create things that I am interested in.
