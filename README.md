ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vidhi Patel. I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at a university. I am very interested in learning more coding languages and softwares as I have created websites and apps. I really like creating things and coding is an outlet for me that allows me to create things that I am interested in. In school, I had taken many PLTW classes that focused on creating things. I took PLTW and Aerospace where I was able to create wooden airplanes and write reports on what types of materials work better and what affects the speed of the plane. Another class I took was Mobile App Development where I learned how to code in Java.

So far, I have learned to code in Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, and Swift. I look forward to expanding my knowledge more and becoming a better programmer.
